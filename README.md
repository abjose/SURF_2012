SURF_2012
=========

Some code from a 2012 summer research project on "Task-Level Robot Controllers Based on a Local Î¼-Calculus Formula".

Specifically, there's code for building quadtree occupancy grids with tesseral arithmetic, and visualizing a robot's position in said occupancy grids along with data from a scanning laser range finder.

It hasn't really been cleaned up at all yet.
